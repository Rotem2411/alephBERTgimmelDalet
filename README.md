# alephBERTgimmelDalet

Welcome to the **alephBERTgimmelDalet project**! 

This repository aims to enhance the performance of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in Hebrew by combining several existing models. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or language enthusiast, this project provides a collaborative space to experiment and contribute.

## Goals

1. **Model Aggregation**: We'll aggregate multiple NLP models, each with its strengths and weaknesses, to create a more robust and accurate solution.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: We'll fine-tune the combined model on Hebrew-specific datasets to improve its performance.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: We'll evaluate the fused model using standard NLP metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and perplexity.
4. **Community Involvement**: We encourage contributions from the communityâ€”whether it's adding new models, improving existing ones, or suggesting novel fusion techniques.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
    - Familiarize yourself with the basics of NLP and machine learning.

2. **Installation**:
    - Clone this repository to your local machine:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/alephBERTgimmelDalet.git
        ```
    - Install the required dependencies:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3. **Data Preparation**:
    - Collect or create a Hebrew NLP dataset for training and evaluation.
    - Preprocess the data (tokenization, normalization, etc.).

4. **Model Selection**:
    - Explore existing Hebrew NLP models (e.g., AlephBERT, AlephBERTgimmel, NEMO).
    - Choose the models you want to fuse.

5. **Model Fusion Techniques**:
    - Investigate different fusion methods:
        - **Ensemble Learning**: Combine predictions from multiple models.
        - **Stacking**: Train a meta-model on predictions from base models.
        - **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfer knowledge from one model to another.
    - Experiment with weighted fusion, feature-level fusion, or output-level fusion.

6. **Training and Evaluation**:
    - Train the fused model using your dataset.
    - Evaluate its performance on held-out test data.
    - Tune hyperparameters as needed.
  
7. **Challenges**:
    - **Morphological Complexity**:
      - Hebrew is a morphologically rich language (MRL). Each input token may consist of multiple lexical and functional units, making it challenging for NLP systems to handle.
      - The morphological complexity affects tasks like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
    - **Limited Annotated Data**:
      - Compared to languages like English, there is a scarcity of annotated data available for Hebrew.
      - Annotated data is crucial for training and evaluating NLP models, but collecting high-quality labeled data in Hebrew remains a challenge.
    - **Small Research Community**:
      - The Hebrew NLP research community is relatively small compared to other languages.
      - Collaborative efforts are essential to address challenges and develop effective solutions.
    - **Architectural Choices**:
      - Choosing appropriate architectures for Hebrew NLP models is critical. Architectures must represent the languageâ€™s features well.
      - The current best practice often involves using multilingual models (such as mBERT) and adapting them to Hebrew.
    - **Fine-Grained Analysi**s:
      - Constructing fine-grained analytic grading rubrics for tasks like automated assessment of scientific explanations in Hebrew is essential.
      - These rubrics help evaluate student responses and provide individualized feedback.
    - **Under-Parameterization and Limited Training Data**:
      - Hebrew NLP models may suffer from under-parameterization due to limited training data.
      - Addressing this challenge requires creative approaches to leverage existing resources effectively.
