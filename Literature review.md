# Literature Review: alephBERTgimmelDalet

## Abstract

Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Hebrew presents unique challenges due to the language's morphological complexity, limited annotated data, and the relatively small research community. In recent years, efforts have been made to address these challenges by combining multiple NLP models to create more robust and accurate solutions. This literature review explores existing research on Hebrew NLP model merging, focusing on techniques, evaluation metrics, and community involvement.

## 1. Introduction

Hebrew, a Semitic language with a rich history, poses specific challenges for NLP tasks. Researchers and practitioners have sought ways to improve Hebrew NLP performance by leveraging merging techniques. This review aims to summarize relevant studies and provide insights into the state of the field.

## 2. Challenges in Hebrew NLP

### 2.1 Morphological Complexity

- Hebrew exhibits intricate morphological patterns, including root-based word formation, inflections, and agglutination.
- Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization become non-trivial tasks due to these complexities.

### 2.2 Limited Annotated Data

- Annotated Hebrew datasets are scarce compared to languages like English.
- Collecting high-quality labeled data remains a challenge.

### 2.3 Small Research Community

- The Hebrew NLP research community is smaller than that of other languages.
- Collaborative efforts are essential for progress.

## 3. Existing Models and Architectures

### 3.1 Multilingual Models

- Researchers often adapt multilingual models (e.g., mBERT) to Hebrew.
- These models provide a starting point for fusion experiments.

### 3.2 Model Selection

- Choosing appropriate base models is crucial.
- alephBERT, alephBERTgimmel, NEMO, and others have been explored.

## 4. Model Merging Techniques

### 4.1 Ensemble Learning

- Combine predictions from multiple models.
- Weighted averaging, majority voting, or stacking.

### 4.2 Knowledge Distillation

- Transfer knowledge from a teacher model to a student model.
- Helps improve performance on resource-constrained tasks.

### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics

- Precision, recall, F1-score, and perplexity.
- Task-specific metrics (e.g., named entity recognition, sentiment analysis).

## 5. Community Involvement

- Open-source repositories (e.g., GitHub) foster collaboration.
- Contributions from researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts are encouraged.

## 6. Conclusion

Hebrew NLP model merging is an active area of research. By addressing challenges, experimenting with fusion techniques, and engaging the community, we can advance the field and create more effective solutions for Hebrew language processing.
